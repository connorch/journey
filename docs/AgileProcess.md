THE SPRINT: SCRUM EVENTS

    Sprint Frequency
    Sprints consisted of three distinct meeting types.  Sprint duration was from two to four days in length. We 
    completed four Sprints.

    Sprint Planning
    Held at the start of each Sprint. Team selects tasks for inclusion and 
    votes on the number of points assigned.

    Daily Scrum
    Held daily or bi-daily. Team members report what they have completed, any blocking or 
    gating issues, and what they plan to work on next.
    
    Sprint Review and Retrospective
    At the end of each Sprint we had a Sprint review and retrospective to examine the work, the communication, and 
    the technology used during the Sprint.  For the review, each team member  discusses what went well during the 
    Sprint, what problems it ran into, and how those problems were solved and answered questions about the work. 
    For the Restrospective, each team member discusses how the last Sprint went with regards to people, relationships, 
    process, and tools. We identified what went well and potential improvements and planned improvements going 
    forward.

THE SPRINT: Scrum Artifacts

    We created a Trello Board with two lists for each Sprint, one for tickets in the Sprint and one for done tickets. 
    A ticket could be for a feature, a bug, we also created tickets to list PRs in the Sprint.  We created lists for the 
    Backlog for tickets waiting to be added to a Sprint, and a Bug Report list ro track items that came up after the 
    Sprint planning and could be worked on. Sprint velocity was
